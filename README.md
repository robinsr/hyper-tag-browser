## Overview

HyperTagBrowser is a sophisticated file management application that goes beyond traditional file 
browsers by providing powerful tagging, filtering, and organization features. Built entirely 
with SwiftUI for macOS, it offers a native experience with modern design patterns and efficient 
file indexing.


## Features

### 🏷️ Advanced Tagging System

- **Multi-domain tagging**: Organize files with descriptive, attribution, creation date, and queue-based tags

- **Tag hierarchies**: Create relationships between tags for better organization
- **Bulk tag operations**: Apply or remove tags from multiple files simultaneously

### 🔍 Powerful Filtering & Search

- **Real-time filtering**: Instantly filter files by tags, dates, artists, creators, and more
- **Complex queries**: Combine multiple filter criteria for precise results
- **Date-based filtering**: Filter by creation dates with flexible date ranges
- **Search suggestions**: Intelligent autocomplete for tag and content search

### 📱 Modern SwiftUI Interface

- **Native macOS design**: Built with SwiftUI following Apple's Human Interface Guidelines
- **Responsive layout**: Adapts to different window sizes and screen configurations
- **Dark mode support**: Full support for light and dark appearance modes
- **Keyboard navigation**: Comprehensive keyboard shortcuts for power users

### 🖼️ Rich Media Support

- **Thumbnail generation**: Automatic thumbnail creation for images and documents
- **Grid and table views**: Multiple viewing modes for different use cases
- **Detail inspector**: Comprehensive file information and metadata display
- **Image preview**: Built-in image viewing with zoom and pan capabilities

### ⚡ Performance & Efficiency

- **Background indexing**: Efficient file system scanning without blocking the UI
- **SQLite database**: Fast, reliable storage for file metadata and tags
- **Memory optimization**: Smart caching and resource management
- **Incremental updates**: Only re-index changed files for better performance

## System Requirements

- **macOS**: 15.0 or later
- **Architecture**: Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) or Intel
- **Memory**: 4GB RAM minimum, 8GB recommended
- **Storage**: 100MB for the application, additional space for database


## Installation

### From Source

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/HyperTagBrowser.git
   cd HyperTagBrowser
   ```

2. **Open in Xcode**
   ```bash
   open TaggedFileBrowser.xcodeproj
   ```

3. **Build and run**
   - Select your target device (Mac)
   - Press `Cmd+R` to build and run
   - Or use `Product > Run` from the menu


### Development Setup

The project uses several dependencies managed through Swift Package Manager:

- **GRDB**: Database layer with SQLite
- **Factory**: Dependency injection
- **Defaults**: User preferences management
- **GRDBQuery**: Reactive database queries
- **MacSettings**: Settings UI components


## Usage

### Getting Started

1. **Launch the app** and grant necessary permissions for file access
2. **Select a folder** to index using the folder picker or drag and drop
3. **Wait for indexing** to complete (progress is shown in the status bar)
4. **Start tagging** files by selecting them and using the tag panel


### Key Features


#### Tagging Files

- Select one or more files
- Open the tag panel (`⌃T`)
- Type tag names and press Enter to apply
- Use tag suggestions for consistency


#### Filtering Content

- Use the browse refinements panel (`⌃F`)
- Add multiple filter criteria
- Combine tags, dates, and other attributes
- Save frequently used filter combinations


#### Navigation

- **Grid view**: Visual browsing with thumbnails
- **Table view**: Detailed list with sortable columns
- **Detail view**: Full file information and preview
- **Sidebar**: Quick access to bookmarks and work queues


### Keyboard Shortcuts

| Action | Shortcut |
